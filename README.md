# Java-classes

This is the second step of my communication with Java. 	:left_speech_bubble:

This repository is dedicated to classes, their representatives and basic ways of inheritance. :sunglasses:

As in the Java-fundamentals, the criteria of successful completion is finished main task (this time no optional tasks). 	:link:

## Requirements of the task

Create classes with the specifications, which are given below: 

* Define **constructors**, methods of **set/get** types, **toString**.

* Define additional methods in the class that creates an array of objects. 

* Set the data selection criteria and output this data to the console. 

* In each class that has information, several constructors must be declared.

======================================================================

Further, based on the requirements above, fill the classes with information

**Ð¡ar**: id, Brand, Model, Year of release, Color, Price, Personal number.

Create an array of objects. You're to output:

1) List of cars of a given brand;

2) list of cars of a given brand that have been in operation for more than 10 years;

3) List of cars of a certain release year, which are more expensive than a given price;

## Installation

Since it is pure Java, you needn't any complicated actions. :trophy:

You are proposed to use Java 8.

There're the steps to unpack my project: 

* git clone Java-Classes

* Open it via your IDE

## Usage

There're no any peculiarities.

As I said before, just open it in your IDE and build the project.

All the materials were taken from the [EPAM Automated Testing course](https://training.epam.com/#!/Training/3044?lang=en). :test_tube:

The backup of the tasks could be found [there](https://github.com/vitalliuss/automation-training.git), in file "backup.md". :file_folder:

Unfortunately they provided only RU verion of the requirements.
